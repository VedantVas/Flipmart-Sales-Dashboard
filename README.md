# Flipmart-Sales-Dashboard
This is the first Dashboard that I created using Microsoft Power BI.

This is made on the dataset named Flipmart Sales Dataset that is very large dataset, which can be helpful in taking insights and start learning Power BI.

This dataset can be easily downloaded from kaggle by searching it through it's name "Flipmart Sales Dataset", or through the attached file.

If you don't have Power BI Desktop right now you can just simply have a look on the screenshot of the dashboard, but I suggest to open it through Power BI Desktop which will provide you an interactive experience of that.
